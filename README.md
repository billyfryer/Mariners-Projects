# Mariners Projects Materials

Inside this repository are all of the files that I used to make my presentation excluding the raw data.

This "README.md" file gives a brief description of all the files/folders in the repository.

The Images folder has the images used in the "Mariners Projects Slides" presentation.

The "Baseball Projects Round Two Prompt 2023.pdf" file is the prompt provided by the Mariners.

The "Create-Report.R" file is the file where I created the PDF Report "Pithcer X Report". This script is primarily for grouping the graphics together. The plots were created in a different script.

The "Mariners Projects Slides.pptx" file were the slides I presented in our last meeting

The "Mariners-Projects-2023.RProj" file was the R Project that I used in tandem with the R Scripts I created. This helped make file paths easier to navigate.

The "Pitcher X Report.pdf" was the PDF file created by "Create-Report.R" script and would be a hand out I gave to the coach to whom I am speaking.

The "Report-Graphics.R" file is the script where I created the Tables/Plots to be used in the final PDF Report. This file is loaded directly into the "Create-Report.R" file.

The "Slide-Graphics.R" file is a script where I created additional graphics (such as the Arm Slots image) for the presentation that I did not include on the "Pitcher X Report.pdf"
